# Project Iris

Project Iris is a smart AR Assistant with speech recognition feature. Iris is an AR fairy which listens to you. She can easily tell you answers to any question with a picture too. You can ask for any object in this world and you'll be presented with a list of 3D models (from Google Poly). Simply select anyone and watch it in AR. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21677583/115877388-01931280-a465-11eb-9ebf-6a9913ac8c0a.png)
